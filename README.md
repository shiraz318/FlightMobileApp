# FlightMobileApp  
## Overview  
In this project we created an android app.  
The app conects to an intermediary server which communicates with a flight simulator.  
In the main screen the user can type an url address of the server or choose a url address from a list of previous used addresses.  
After pressing the "Connect" button, the control screen will be shown.
